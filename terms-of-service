Last updated Dec 17, 2021

These Consumer Purchase Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) are a legal agreement between you and Biktrix Enterprises Inc. operating as Biktrix Electric Bikes, a Saskatchewan corporation (“BEB”, “us” or “we”), and apply to all consumer purchases by you of any model of BEB’s electric bikes (“ebike(s)”) and/or related accessories or other products offered by BEB (collectively with ebikes, the “Products”) in Canada. Purchases outside Canada must be made through the international website (www.biktrix.com) and are subject to the applicable Terms and Conditions contained on that website. By purchasing any Products from BEB, whether online or at our showroom, or by using the Products you thereby agree to these Terms in their entirety. Please read these Terms carefully as they list your obligations and rights and include a requirement that all disputes that you may have under these Terms be taken to arbitration, instead of a jury trial or class action.

1. Application

Limited Warranty Terms
Terms of Use
Privacy Notice
Owner’s Manual
A copy of these Terms and all other documents which apply to your purchase of Products are available for you to read on our website.

2. Ebike Online Or In-Store Orders
In the event you are purchasing an ebike

(i) by ordering online,
 (ii) in an BEB retail store (as opposed to a direct purchase in store of in-stock item), or
 (iii) through Biktrix Mobile Service, your order of an ebike is an offer to buy.
BEB will send you an email confirming our receipt of your order. BEB has accepted your order upon shipment of the ebike. We reserve the right at any time, even after we send you a confirmation email, to decline or cancel your order or to limit order quantities for any reason, including errors or suspected fraud.

From time to time, in its sole discretion, BEB may promote special offers, codes or referral programs for certain sales or product launches. Special offers, codes, and referral programs may not be combined and BEB reserves the right to end or pause all such offers, codes, or programs at any time.

 (iii) make a purchase on www.Biktrix.com in an amount greater than the minimum amount specified in the referral offer, and
 (iv) not use any other active promotion or discount on their purchase.
Referring customers will receive a Referral Reward after the referral is confirmed and the referral credit is approved by a customer service member. Customers are limited to referring two (2) people per household. Referring customers may only earn one (1) referral credit per referred person. In the event a referred person returns a purchased Product and their lifetime order value decreases below the minimum purchase amount, the referral credit awarded to the referring customer will be rescinded. Customers may not refer anyone who has an existing www.Biktrix.com account under an alternate email address.

Any abuse of this offer, as determined by us in our sole discretion, may result in the rescission of

(i) the referring customer's referral credit,
 (ii) the referred person's promo code; and
 (iii) both parties' ability to participate in this or future promotions.
Referral credit cannot be applied to previous purchases and is not redeemable for cash. This referral program is subject to modification or termination at any time without notice in our sole discretion.

4. Shipping
All orders under $150 qualify for a flat rate $25 shipping charge. Select orders of $150 or more may qualify for free shipping. Products excluded from the flat rate shipping and free shipping offer are: Batteries ($60 shipping charge per item). Palletized freight orders are subject to additional fees.

A shipping confirmation email will be sent to the email address attached to the order once the order has shipped.
We will use FedEx or other parcel service to ship your order. We DO NOT ship to PO BOXES or APO.
Orders containing discounted merchandise may take an additional forty-eight (48) hours to process.
For all international orders, you are solely responsible for ensuring you comply with all applicable local/state/federal regulations concerning the import and use of electric bicycles. Acceptance of orders outside of the United States shall be in BEB’s sole discretion.
Any changes that you make regarding shipping once the item is shipped, including but not limited to changing the address, putting an order on hold, or updating shipping settings/preferences may delay your receipt of the Products and replacement Products and/or refunds. If you would like to change the color or size of your ebike, you must do so prior to your order being PROCESSED. When an order is Processed, you get an email confirmation stating that NO CHANGES are permitted at this time.
Please note we are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or damaged items due to the actions or inactions of FedEx or any other parcel service.
You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. We recommend using a trackable shipping service and purchasing shipping insurance. We cannot guarantee that we will receive the item you are attempting to return. For more information regarding our limited warranty and claims process, please review our Limited Warranty Terms, which are incorporated into by reference and form a part of these Terms.
For any third-party shipping outside of BEB’s normal shipping process, BEB cannot provide ANY additional shipping information or documentation.
For orders placed through our online store (www.Biktrix.com) with the shipping address of a BEB retail location, expect delays in delivery, please contact the respective showroom for availability, delivery timelines and other details before placing the showroom pick-up order. To purchase Products in-store, please locate a BEB retail showroom near you.
While BEB will try its best to coordinate with the carrier company to get the product delivered, it is the responsibility of the consignee to keep track of the shipment and to coordinate with the carrier for tracking updates and to get the shipment delivered or rescheduled for delivery.
In case of a failed delivery, the consignee is responsible for coordinating and collecting the consignment from the carrier’s assigned location/ pick-up point at the consignee’s cost. If the tracking shows ‘Out for Delivery’ but the package remains undelivered, the consignee should coordinate with the carrier and not Biktrix Inc. It must be noted that some carriers do not allow pre-scheduled delivery or custom delivery timelines/ options, Biktrix Inc. cannot be held responsible for the absence of such services.
All shipping charges are non-refundable. A consignment cannot be considered as ‘LOST’ unless declared by the contracted carrier and therefore BEB cannot be held liable for any shipment that does not show tracking updates after it has departed the BEB’s dispatch facility.
Failed Deliveries: If a shipment is refused by the receiver or delivery returned for any reason, the customer is responsible for the shipment fee both ways (to and from the customer address).
It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that the shipping address on the order is accurate. If a shipment is lost or damaged or returned due to wrong address, the customer is responsible for all the shipping costs and other costs associated with that shipment.
All Shipping Damages must be reported within 48 hours of delivery. In the event where you receive your package and there is product damage, an investigation will be conducted. During this period of investigation, BEB reserves the right to issue a replacement.
5. Ownership
Title to all Products ordered by you and risk of loss to such Products will transfer to you at the time BEB delivers such Products to the applicable shipping carrier.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we have not received payment in full for the Products prior to their delivery, then the Products will remain our property until such time as payment is received in full. We reserve the right (subject to applicable law) to terminate your right to use the Products if payment is not made when due, or if the credit/debit card company declines payment or requires us to return any payment made for the Products, for any reason.

Refunds/ Reimbursements

All refunds/ reimbursements are at the sole discretion of BEB and to the original mode of payment only. In case the original payment mode has changed/ disabled it is the responsibility of the customer to inform BEB about the same as early as possible. Failure to do so may result in a ‘lost’ or suspended transaction and under no circumstances can BEB be held liable for the misplaced transaction or asked for a repeat of a refund to another payment mode. In such cases, the onus is on the customer to contact the relevant financial institution and secure the transaction.

While we take all measures to process the approved refunds as soon as possible, there are delays sometimes at the financial merchant’s interface, BEB  cannot be held responsible for delays in the processing of refunds/ reimbursements and the inconvenience/ loss caused due to it.

The original transaction fee of 3.5% is non-refundable on Paypal.

Beyond 60 Days of payment all refunds/ reimbursements would be in the form of Store Credits.

19. R-E-S-P-E-C-T towards BEB staff
We pride ourselves in being nothing but respectful, kind, patient, friendly, and all other pleasant terms that could fit in the mix, and it is critical that those things are returned to our team by customers. We understand that oftentimes when you call/email customer support, it is because something has gone wrong or there is an issue with your purchase (which is the worst!). We also understand that these potential issues cause frustration and sometimes anger; however, we will NOT tolerate rude/vulgar language or sexual innuendos/ hints/ comments towards our staff. We will offer a warning if this occurs, after which we do reserve the right to refuse service, terminate your account, issue refunds, void warranties, or cancel orders, each at our sole discretion. If this decision is made it is final and cannot be undone.

Abuse:

Biktrix Inc. considers all its customers and clients extremely valuable, but our employees are invaluable to us. We expect all our customers and clients to behave in a civilized manner with our employees, agents, support staff, showroom personnel, and dealers and treat them with RESPECT at all times. In case of a grievance, the respective issue must be brought to the attention of the support team in a respectful way while communicating on any channel. We understand that oftentimes certain situations can cause anger and frustration to get the better of a human being, however, we will not condone such behaviour irrespective of the circumstances.

Swearing or profanity is strictly prohibited on all forms of messaging and such clients would be blocked permanently if they fail to comply after a written warning has been issued to them. Biktrix Inc. adopts a ‘Zero-Tolerance’ policy against any form of verbal/ non-verbal/ physical/ mental/ emotional/ direct/ in-direct/ racial abuse/ harassment/ bullying or slandering towards any personnel of Biktrix Inc. We reserve the right to irrevocably decide to terminate accounts, reject service, cancel orders, discontinue our relationship under such cases including forfeiture of the remaining warranty at our discretion.

20. Local Bike Shop - Terms Of Service
In instances where the bike needs to be serviced at a Local Bike Shop, the customer must procure a pre-authorization from BEB to proceed ahead with the warranty claims. Failure to secure a pre-authorization may result in the rejection of the warranty claim made for such works.

Pre- Authorization: Before proceeding with service at a Local Bike Shop, BEB will issue a pre-authorization for an appropriate amount based on the nature of the work that needs to be carried out on the bike.

In cases where the customer receives an estimate from the Local Bike Shop that is more than the pre-authorized amount. It is the responsibility of the customer to secure a revised pre-authorization. Failure to do this excludes BEB from any liability to compensate for the invoice beyond the pre-authorization.

If the customer willfully proceeds with the repair work that costs more than the pre-authorized amount, BEB is liable to only compensate the customer for the amount that was pre-authorized and will not cover the entire amount on the Invoice of the Work.

Diagnostics: In certain cases, BEB will pre-authorize an amount for our customer to take their bike to a local bike shop for diagnostics of the issue. This is intended as a fault-finding process, to have an experienced bike mechanic look at the bike and provide insight into the issue and repair options and to provide a quote for the actual work to fix the problem.

If the bike shop proceeds with the actual work when we have only pre-authorized for diagnostics, then the customer should not assume that BEB will reimburse them for the warranty claim. In such cases, the reimbursement of the warranty claim and the amount of refund would be at the sole discretion of BEB .

Reimbursement for work: Once the job is completed the customer must send us a copy of the invoice and BEB will reimburse/ refund the customer via the original payment method that was used to purchase the bike.

In case the customer wants BEB to pay the bike shop directly, this would need an additional 5 business days to process the payment on BEB’s end. The payments can be made via electronic means only.

Coordination: If the local bike shop requires the customer to leave the bike at a local bike shop for a certain number of days it is the responsibility of the customer to coordinate with the bike shop and seek information regarding the progress of the work on the bike. BEB agents may communicate with the Bike Shop via Telephone and emails during regular BEB business hours, however, it is the owner’s responsibility to be part of all types of communication between the Bike Shop and BEB. Under no circumstances BEB or one of our agents can be held responsible for the job that is done at a Local Bike Shop. In the instance that the local bike shop needs parts that are specifically available from BEB, they need to send a request for these through the original owner of the bike. BEB will not accept parts requests received from the local bike shop directly.

It is the responsibility of the customer to be looped into the proceedings at the local bike shop and to ensure that any emails regarding the work must have relevant people CC'd for transparent communication. BEB  cannot be held responsible for delays at the local bike shop for any reason whatsoever.

Storage Fees: Some bike shops may charge storage fees on bikes that are waiting for parts/ troubleshooting purposes or any similar reason thereof. In cases like these, the customer must pay for the storage fee or take the bike back until such time that the parts have been received and the local bike shop is able to commence work on the bike. BEB  will not cover the Storage Fee at Bike Shops.
